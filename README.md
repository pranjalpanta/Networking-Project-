#🚀 Enterprise Networking Mini Project – Cisco Packet Tracer

I recently completed a small Enterprise Networking Project using Cisco Packet Tracer, where I designed and configured a multi-department network with VLANs, wireless access, and inter-VLAN routing.

🔹Project Summary
The network included three departments:
 • Admin/IT – VLAN 20
 • Finance/HR – VLAN 30
 • Reception – VLAN 40
Each department received its own subnet, WiFi network, and automatic IP allocation.

🔧Technical Highlights
• VLAN Segmentation: Configured VLANs 20/30/40 for secure traffic separation.
 • Inter-VLAN Routing: Implemented Router-on-a-Stick using dot1q sub-interfaces.
 • DHCP Pools: Provided dynamic IP addressing per department.
 • Wireless Setup: Deployed SSIDs (ADMIN-WIFI, FINANCE-WIFI, RECEPTION-WIFI) with WPA2-PSK.
 • Subnetting: Divided 192.168.1.0into three /26 networks for organized IP allocation.
 • Testing: Verified connectivity across PCs, laptops, printers, and wireless devices.
